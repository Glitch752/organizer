# Organizer
(better name pending)

I've never been content with the existing solutions for note-taking and personal organization. My requirements are:
- Extremely responsive, offline-first experience without frequent replication conflicts
- Simple, keyboard-centric UI
- Hierarchical note structure with backlinks and tags
- Calendar and note-taking integrated in one application
- Visual WYSIWYG editor
- End-user accessible plugins for e.g. querying tasks and calculating required time
- Fast, local full-text and fuzzy search
- Export/import to common formats (Markdown, plain text)
- PWA with a responsive mobile interface

Here are some non-goals of this project:
- Customizable UI
- End-to-end encryption
- Straightforward data storage format (e.g. markdown with frontmatter)
- Support for multiple users
- Project management beyond simple tasks
- Storing attachments
- Safe, sandboxed plugin API
- Thorough accessibility support

If others begin using this application and are interested in implementing these non-goals, however, I would accept pull requests!

## Inspiration
- [Silverbullet](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet). I love Silverbullet's flexibility and visual editor, but I've had issues with syncronization and would like to build something more tailored for my needs.
